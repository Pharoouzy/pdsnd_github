### Project Title

US Bikeshare Data Analysis Tool

### Description

This project utilizes data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a leading bike share system provider in the United States, to explore and compare bike-sharing usage patterns in three major cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. Employing Python for data importation, cleaning, imputation, and analysis, I generated descriptive statistics to delve into key usage trends. The project also features an interactive terminal interface, allowing users to tailor their queries and gain insights into specific aspects of bike-sharing.

The project provides valuable insights into the functioning and utilization of urban bike-sharing systems, serving the interests of city planners, local residents, and transport enthusiasts alike.

### Files used

1. **bikeshare.py**: This Python file contains the core code that powers the analysis tool. It includes functions for data importation, cleaning, and computation of descriptive statistics.
2. **washington.csv**: This CSV file provides the raw data on bike-sharing usage in Washington, D.C., supplied by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/). It serves as one of the datasets analyzed by the bikeshare.py tool.
3. **new_york_city.csv**:  Similar to the Washington file, this CSV file contains raw data for bike-sharing usage in New York City. It is another key dataset subjected to analysis in this project.
4. **chicago.csv**: This file holds the raw bike-sharing data for Chicago, completing the trio of cities under study. It too is analyzed by the bikeshare.py tool.

> **Note**: The CSV files—chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, and washington.csv—are not uploaded to the remote repository due to their large size, and they are listed in the .gitignore file.
